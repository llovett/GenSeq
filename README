GenSeq -----#####

GenSeq (a working title) is a free MIDI generative sequencer application. It is only a few weeks
old, so is in need of a lot of help. Currently, only very basic features are implemented. Most of
the documentation of this project can be found inside of comments within the code itself, so dig
in! The basic concept of this project follows.

The user designs a generative score based on a graph constructed of Nodes and Edges. A Node may
represent any musical event, and it is connected to any number of other nodes. Each node plays
its musical event specified by a corresponding likelihood. (TODO:) A connected component of the
overall graph can be encapsulated in a MetaNode, which can be treated as any other Node in the
contruction of the graph. This allows the user to create larger non-deterministic musical
structures. Multiple layers of generative scores (up to 16) allow for complex counterpoint.
